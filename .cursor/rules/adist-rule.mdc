# Adist Project: adist

## Project Exploration

This project is indexed with Adist, a semantic search and AI assistant tool.

### For AI assistants

- Use `adist get "query"` to find relevant code
- Use `adist get "term1 AND term2"` for advanced searching (both terms must match)
- Use `adist query "question"` to get AI-powered answers
- Use `adist chat` for interactive conversations about the codebase
- Use `adist summary` to see project summaries
- Use `adist inspect-file <file>` to analyze file structure
- Use `adist list` to show all indexed projects
- Use `adist switch <projectName>` to switch between projects

### Commands to know

- Initialize: `adist init [projectName]` (use `--force` to override existing project)
- Search: `adist get "<query>"`
- Advanced Search: `adist get "term1 AND term2 AND term3"` (all terms must match)
- Query: `adist query "<question>"`
- Chat: `adist chat` (use /exit to end session)
- List projects: `adist list`
- Switch projects: `adist switch <projectName>`
- Reindex: `adist reindex`

Adist splits documents into semantic blocks for more precise searching.
